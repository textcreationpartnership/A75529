            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the injuries, and abu≈øes done unto us are many, and the grievances, and oppre≈ø≈øions which hereupon we have ≈øuffered at ≈øundry times are manifold: wherefore we in the generall, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niver≈øall name of Us all, doe pre≈øume to pre≈øent our pre≈ø≈øures, and impendent injuries to your Honours, of whom onely we can expect redre≈ø≈øe, and of none other. For whereas this City hath bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the gazing eye of the world, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent enemies thereof applauded (both to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fame of this State, and Kingdome) of all other Neighbour Countries, and Nations: Yet the Rites, and Liberties thereof being ≈øomewhat detracted, &amp; abu≈øed, as al≈øo the Lawes and ancient Cu≈øtomes thereof being extenuated by ≈øome malignant, and ill-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, it now becomes as much deplorable in the ≈øight of all men: and whereas this City ≈øhould have been a Patterne of Piety, and goodne≈ø≈øe (regularly embraced) to the whole Kingdome be≈øides, it is now (by the means of divers ill-planted members hereof) become an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Schi≈ømaticall di≈øturbances, and di≈øtractions. We therefore implore your Honours withall humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to re≈øtore our former Liberties, of which lately we
<pb facs="tcp:111382:3"/>have been deprived and to regulate in an exact ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation the Lawes, and pri≈øtine Statutes of this City to the pre≈øervation of them (of which there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite nece≈ø≈øity in the≈øe perilous and confu≈øed times) in confirming the ≈øaid ancient cu≈øtome hereof.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt we be≈øeech your Honours to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration the intolerable abu≈øe of our Apprenti≈øhip: for where, we by coerion are nece≈ø≈øarily compelled to ≈øerve ≈øeven, or eight yeares at lea≈øt, before wee can have the immunity and freedome of this City to trade in: Tho≈øe which are meere Strangers doe ≈ønatch this Freedome from us, and pull the Trades out of our owne hands, ≈øo that by this meanes when our times are fully expired, wee doe then begin in a manner to ≈øuffer a ≈øecond Apprenti≈øhip to them, who doe thus domineere over us in our owne Trades.</p>
            <p>This is the cau≈øe that ≈øo many breake every yeare, ≈øeeing that their Trading is ≈øtolne out of their hands to the great di≈øcomfort, and confu≈øion of us all. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when we are out of our times, and ≈øhould then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to trade in the world, we can get neither Hou≈øe, or Shop for our money, in regard that the≈øe Forraigners, and ≈øtrangers (as there are many <hi>French, Dutch, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loones,</hi> &amp;c.) will give any money to ≈ønatch them from us: and this is the chiefe≈øt cau≈øe, that hou≈øes are ≈øo exce≈ø≈øive deare in this City, and by this meanes many of us loo≈øe the lo≈ø≈øe of yeares, trade, and time, and are compelled to turne Journeymen. Wherefore we ≈øole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on your Honours favourable, gracious, and auxiliary opitulation, be≈øeeching you to re-erect that, which lately have been pull'd downe.

            <p>Moreover we earne≈øtly de≈øire your Honours, that you would be plea≈øed to ≈øend ≈øome ≈øpeedy ayde, and auxiliary a≈ø≈øi≈øtance unto them: for otherwi≈øe it will be a great detriment and dammage to divers in this City, in re≈øpect that mo≈øt of your Petitioners Ma≈øters have great ≈øummes of money, which many of tho≈øe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants doe owe unto them. In that regard they will be great loo≈øers thereby, unle≈ø≈øe they be re≈øtored unto their former e≈øtate, which will be a meanes to breake and undoe many in this Cittie, to the great di≈øcomfort and lo≈ø≈øe of your Petitioners. Therefore we be≈øeech you to revolve the manifold abu≈øes, which they have done, and unle≈ø≈øe you that are the reall Phi≈øitians of the ≈øtate (to purge this Kingdome from tho≈øe Sores that doth contaminate it) doe lay a re≈øtoratiue plai≈øter to tho≈øe mortall wounds, that are given by the Papi≈øts, they will ≈øuddenly canker, and turne to Phlebotomie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:111382:4"/>
            <p> Alas, 'tis unknowne what danger we are involved in, neither can we receive any comfort in our trade, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of the≈øe manifold perils which your Petitioners Ma≈øters are in, both in danger of their e≈øtates, and feare of their lives.</p>
            <p>Omit not there fore we intreat you, ≈øo heavy, and weighty an importance, ≈øeeing that our nece≈ø≈øary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance waites on your Honours, to relieve us.

            <p>But that we may con≈øummate all our greivances, and nece≈ø≈øities in one bundle, and that you may give your Verdict to each particular of our pre≈ø≈øures in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, we will proceed to our third griefe, expecting herein your favourable reflection on us, <hi>viz,</hi> the in≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Domination of the Lordly Bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and ≈øome others, who triumph with too much arrogant in≈øolencie over us, and their poore Bretheren of the Cleargie, and if plea≈øe your honours to looke backe on their mi≈ødemeanors, you may ea≈øily conceive how many great and un≈øufferable crimes they ≈øtand guiltie of, wherefore on bended knees (expre≈ø≈øing the humble allegiance of our hearts) we your Petitioners intreate your Honours with a favorable a≈øpect to view the ju≈øt de≈øires of this oppre≈ø≈øed <hi>J≈øarel,</hi> let not we be≈øeech you the≈øe <hi>Ab≈øoloms</hi> that in the time they had Pattents for their per≈øecution) made it no ≈øcruple to per≈øecute their owne fathers, let them not linger protract not time, but let not their puni≈øhments be any longer deferd, for they haue oppre≈ø≈øed the whole Kingdome, they were the fir≈øt cau≈øe of that Commotion in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But now (thankes be to God) concluded
